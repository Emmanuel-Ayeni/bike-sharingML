1. The experiment names to include "bike" to differentiate them from other datasets:

* HPO_EXPERIMENT_NAME = "random-forest-hyperopt-bike"
* EXPERIMENT_NAME = "random-forest-best-models-bike"


2. Updated the help text for the --data_path option to mention bike trip data:

* help="Location where the processed bike trip data was saved"

3. Changed the registered model name to include "bike":

* mlflow.register_model(model_uri, name="rf-best-model-bike")

 This script will work with the bike dataset, assuming you have prepared the data in the same format (train.pkl, val.pkl, test.pkl) and have run the hyperparameter optimization experiment beforehand.
